App Description: Allow users to research pokemon, store their top 5 pokemon and then retrieve previous data. It takes a while to load on render.com

**IMPORTANT** The render website initially will say error fetching Pok√©mon data. This is just because render.com is slow, so it may take a couple of minutes for it to fully load, but rest assured, the program is functional.
